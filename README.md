# PianoSightReader
Generates random notes on a treble clef. They scroll from right to left across the screen. Connect your midi keyboard or use a virtual one. Like this ./pv /dev/midi2. It generates random notes across the screen and you have to press the matching note on the keyboard. If you get it wrong or the notes reach the other side, you lose. Notes get faster over time
